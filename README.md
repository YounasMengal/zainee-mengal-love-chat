## Tech Stack

## Getting Started
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   - `C:\\Users\\Baba Mengal\\CascadeProjects\\zainee-mengal-love-chat`
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` and set a strong `SESSION_SECRET` and your passwords for the two users.
4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   # or for auto-reload during development
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open the app in your browser:
   - `http://localhost:3000`

## Default Pages
- `/login` â€” sign in as `Zainee` or `Mengal`
- `/home` â€” welcome page with the message "This world belongs only to Zainee & Mengal ðŸ’•"
- `/chat` â€” private real-time chat
- `/lovewall` â€” save your love notes forever
- `/game` â€” cute tic-tac-toe
- `/music` â€” shared music corner

## Notes Storage
Love Wall notes are saved to `data/notes.json`. This is a simple JSON file intended for personal use. For production deployment, consider a database.

## Security Tips
- Always configure strong passwords in `.env`
- Change `SESSION_SECRET` to a long random string
- When deploying, set `NODE_ENV=production` to enforce secure cookies

Enjoy your private love world! ðŸ’–
